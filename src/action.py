# =============================================================================
#
# Hey, Makers!
#
# This file contains some examples of voice commands that are handled locally,
# right on your Raspberry Pi.
#
# Do you want to add a new voice command? Check out the instructions at:
# https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/#makers-guide-3-3--create-a-new-voice-command-or-action
# (MagPi readers - watch out! You should switch to the instructions in the link
#  above, since there's a mistake in the MagPi instructions.)
#
# In order to make a new voice command, you need to do two things. First, make a
# new action where it says:
#   "Implement your own actions here"
# Secondly, add your new voice command to the actor near the bottom of the file,
# where it says:
#   "Add your own voice commands here"
#
# =============================================================================

# Actions might not use the user's command. pylint: disable=unused-argument


# Example: Say a simple response
# ================================
#
# This example will respond to the user by saying something. You choose what it
# says when you add the command below - look for SpeakAction at the bottom of
# the file.
#
# There are two functions:
# __init__ is called when the voice commands are configured, and stores
# information about how the action should work:
#   - self.say is a function that says some text aloud.
#   - self.words are the words to use as the response.
# run is called when the voice command is used. It gets the user's exact voice
# command as a parameter.

# into helpful text (for example, "It is twenty past four."). The run function
# uses to_str say it aloud.
